This repository hosts the source code and documentation for a custom AI-powered chatbot, built using Chatbase and integrated into a personal website interface. The chatbot is specifically designed to assist users by answering a wide range of questions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and associated concepts.

Key Features
Comprehensive AI Support:
The bot provides accurate and easy-to-understand explanations for topics including, but not limited to:
1. Machine Learning.
2. Deep Learning.
3. Natural Language Processing.
4. Neural Networks.
5. Model Evaluation and Optimization.

Multi-turn Dialogue Handling:
Users can ask follow-up questions on the same topic, allowing for deeper learning and ongoing clarification.

Contextual Suggestions:
The bot recommends related AI concepts, offers study paths, and proposes learning modules based on the user‚Äôs interests and current topic.

Citations and References:
It provides non-clickable (plain text) URLs and citations to educational sources, bootcamp material, and documentation for users to copy and explore further.

Cross-linking Concepts:
Responses often reference related terms, helping learners build a mental model of interconnected AI concepts.

Web Integration (In Progress)
A dedicated frontend website is under development to host and visually integrate the chatbot for public use. While the site is currently running locally on the developer‚Äôs workstation, future plans include:
1. Deployment to a public hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
2. Responsive design for accessibility across devices.
3. Interactive UI with conversational history, links, and search capability.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Planned / In Use):
Chatbase (AI backend powered by ChatGPT).
HTML/CSS/ (frontend).
GitHub (version control and collaboration).

Future integration: JavaScript, React or Next.js for a dynamic user interface.

üöÄ Future Development Goals:
1. Online deployment of the chatbot UI.
2. Enable clickable links and embedded content previews.
3. Analytics dashboard for user interactions and common questions.
4. Admin interface for updating training data and FAQs.
